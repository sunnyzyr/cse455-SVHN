# Street View House Numbers
Group Member: Sunny Zheng, Yanfeng Cui, Melody Zhang

## Project Description
Object recognition and image processing have become one of the hottest topics in machine learning due to their vast and creative potential applications in the real world. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful, such as measuring the quality of NYC Bike Lanes through street imagery. The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is one of the most popular ones within this field. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to read house numbers and match them to their geolocations. Our project aimed to learn and train a model that can accurately identify street numbers.

## Dataset
The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a Pythorch build-in image classification dataset that contains over 600k labeled real-world images of house numbers taken from Google Street View. The sequence of numbers in the images is of bounded length.

train_32x32.mat: 73,257 digits for training
test._32x32.mat: 26,032 digits for testing
extra_32x32.mat: 531,131 additional, less difficult samples, to use as extra training data

## Algorithms/Techniques
We will use machine learning and neural networks in modeling street view house numbers dataset. We plan to build a predictive model with neural networks, feed the model with some sample data, and make some changes to hidden layers to raise the accuracy level. We might use different predictive models to test which one is the best fit. In the process of feeding data to models, we might need to extract features from the input image, and then feed the features into logistic regression classifiers and other models for comparison. Also, SVM is a popular machine learning model for classification that we might use in our project.

## Note
Our project might change as we work on it.
